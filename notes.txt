Notes:
Have now finished the navbar, landing page, and about us page, there is more i can still do to improve
the structure and aesthetic of the about us page, which i may come to at a later date.
i am beginning to notice/anticipate an issue that may come up when it comes time to adjust the structure
of the webpage based on the device being used to see it. 
i may have styled most of the elements in such a way that when it comes time to tweak and shift things
to better accomodate a smaller or larger screen size i may have alot of extra work i could have avoided earlier
on by being more oraganised and planned out with my positioning.
Goals: 
• I still need to add the correct fonts
• Add favicon
• Consider accessibilty requirements, and make any changes necessary 
• Work on accomodations pages (attempt to make styling simple to change for different screen sizes)
