Notes:
Have now finished the navbar, landing page, and about us page, there is more i can still do to improve
the structure and aesthetic of the about us page, which i may come to at a later date.
i am beginning to notice/anticipate an issue that may come up when it comes time to adjust the structure
of the webpage based on the device being used to see it. 
i may have styled most of the elements in such a way that when it comes time to tweak and shift things
to better accomodate a smaller or larger screen size i may have alot of extra work i could have avoided earlier
on by being more oraganised and planned out with my positioning.
Goals: 
• I still need to add the correct fonts
• Add favicon
• Consider accessibilty requirements, and make any changes necessary 
• Work on accomodations pages (attempt to make styling simple to change for different screen sizes)

Notes: 
finished two of three pages for the accomodations page, more will be done later when i go back and add
all the right fonts.
Goals: 
•make the navbar have a 50% transparant dark background so that it is clear to see each nav link against
 the webpage.

Notes: Decided against adding placeholder text in the form. still need to sort out different screen sizes. 
in future i would also like to add hover effects to buttons and links. 
now that i have started working on the different screen sizes i have realised that ive made a mistake,
i had first styled everything for a screen size of the laptop i have been using, this has made it so that 
to style the smaller screen sizes, i need to more or less completely redo all of the styling for those sizes.

Notes: done the majority of the smaller screen size (mobile phone) still have a few things to tweak, 
and still have the navbar left aswell, will probably need to create a dropdown function so the nav links
dont look to small. 
Goals: 
• style navbar for smaller screen size (mobile phone) 
• check code for errors

Notes: i have added a drop down label to the navbar for the smaller screen size, to do this i had to 
add html code, which means ill need to go back to the laptop screen size styling and adjust that too, 
but ive more or less fully completed the styling for the mobile screen size now, one thing i still need
to do is figure out why i cant uncheck the dropdown checkbox. since after checking it and revealing the
navbar clicking it again to uncheck it doesnt do anything.
